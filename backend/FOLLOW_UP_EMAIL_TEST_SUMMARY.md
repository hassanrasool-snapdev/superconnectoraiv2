# Follow-Up Email System Test Summary

## Task Completed ✅
Successfully simulated 3 test transactions in the follow-up email queue and tested the email capability.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Critical Bug Fixed: `yes_url` and `no_url` Undefined Error
**Problem:** The follow-up email generation was failing with error: `name 'yes_url' is not defined`

**Root Cause:** In `backend/app/routers/follow_up_emails.py`, the `send_individual_follow_up` function was referencing `yes_url` and `no_url` variables that were not defined.

**Fix Applied:** Added proper URL generation before using the variables:
```python
# Generate response URLs
yes_url = f"http://localhost:3000/warm-intro-response-demo?response=yes&request_id={request_id}"
no_url = f"http://localhost:3000/warm-intro-response-demo?response=no&request_id={request_id}"
```
